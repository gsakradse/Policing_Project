# Policing_Project

## Basic idea:

A handbill type flayer which contains as much neatly presented data as possible on the reasons folks are angry at american policing. The concept is that it can be printed and distributed to folks confused about the issues raised by protesters, it's also a convenient format for digital dissemination on FB/instagram/etc. 

Issues highlighted can include, for example things from this ever expanding list:

* Racial disparities in police killings.
* Racial disparities in police contacts.
* Racial disparities in incarceration.
* International comparisons in incarceration.
* Budget vs. crime rate.
* Budget vs. police contacts.
* Budget vs. police violence.
* Education budgets vs. police budgets.
* Mental health-care budgets vs. police budgets.
* How many fucking tanks these fuckers have.

## Data sources:

* [The Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/)

   Data on contacts, traffic and pedestrian stops. Direct from departments.

* [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/)

    Data on police killings, has race data, it seems only deaths not general use of force. Crowdsourced. 

* [Fatal Encounters](https://fatalencounters.org/)

    Data on police killings. Crowdsourced.

* [U.S. Police Shootings Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cEGQ3eAFKpFBVq1k2mZIy5mBPxC6nBTJHzuSWtZQSVw/edit#gid=1144428085)

    I believe this is the database used for the Fatal Encounters data. 

* [FBI Uniform Crime Reporting](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s)

    National crime rates from 1995-2019, surprisingly poorly organized but quite rich. Also contains information about number of police employees by location.

* [Census Data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/?#)

    Clunky but exhaustive demographics data.


* [Urban Institute State and Local Finance Data](https://state-local-finance-data.taxpolicycenter.org/pages.cfm)

    Just what it sounds like, has info on education, and police budgets, along with a lot more.
